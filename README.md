# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." It utilizes HTML for the structure of the webpage, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and game logic.

### HTML Structure:

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the game, including elements like buttons for the player to choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors), placeholders for displaying the game outcome (win, lose, or draw), and a scoreboard to keep track of the score.

### CSS Styling:

CSS is used to style the game elements, including defining the appearance of the buttons, scoreboard, and overall layout of the game interface. 

### JavaScript Logic:

JavaScript is the backbone of the game, providing the logic for how the game operates. It includes functions to:
1) Generate a random move (rock, paper, or scissors) for the computer opponent.
2) Compare the player's move with the computer's move to determine the winner.
3) Update the scoreboard based on the game outcome.
4) Display messages indicating whether the player won, lost, or drew the round.
5) Keep track of the overall score across multiple rounds.

### Game Flow:

When the player clicks on a button to choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors), the JavaScript code triggers the game logic.
1) The computer randomly selects its move.
2) The player's move is compared to the computer's move to determine the winner.
3) The scoreboard is updated accordingly, and a message is displayed to inform the player of the round outcome.
4) The game continues until the player decides to stop.

#### Overall, this Rock, Paper, Scissors project is a fun and interactive way to learn and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while creating a classic game for users to enjoy.
